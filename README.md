## Features

- **Sign Up Options**: Choose to sign up as a **Bookstore Owner** or browse as a **Browser**.
- **Book Browsing**: Browsers can explore new books and discover bookstores (note: no search functionality is available, so you explore at your own pace).
- **Contact Bookstore Owners**: Browsers can contact bookstore owners directly via WhatsApp, Instagram, or other methods provided in the owner's profile description.
- **Bookstore Owner Tools**: Bookstore owners can:
  - Create profiles for their stores, including contact details like phone numbers or social media accounts.
  - Add books to their store listings.
  - Browse the app just like a regular user.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account as a **Bookstore Owner** or explore the app as a **Browser**.
2. **Explore**: Browsers can check out books and bookstores without a search functionâ€”discovering things on your own is part of the fun! If you find a book or store you like, use the contact information in the owner's profile to get in touch.
3. **Manage Your Store**: If you're a bookstore owner, create a profile, add books, and interact with the app just like a browser.
